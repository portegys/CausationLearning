# Causation learning.

Learn cause-and-effect events in random event streams that contain generated cause-and-effect sequences.
A cause-and-effect sequence has a single effect event and one or more cause events. The cause events
can occur in any order. Cause and effect events can be separated by 0 or more intervening events. 
The task is two-fold: (1) predict the effect given the cause(s), and (2) identify the cause events.

The aim of this project is to build more generalized mediator neurons for the Mona neural network.
