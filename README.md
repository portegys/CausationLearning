# Causation learning.

Learn causations in event streams that contain cause-and-effect sequences. A cause-and-effect
sequence has a single effect event and one or more cause events. The cause events can occur in
an arbitrary order. Cause and effect events can be separated by 0 or more intervening events.

One aim of this project is to build more generalized mediator neurons for the Mona neural network.
